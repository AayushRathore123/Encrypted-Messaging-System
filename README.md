# Encrypted Messaging System
This project is used for a secure messaging by ensuring person's confidentiality, integrity, and 
privacy when sending text messages to one another. No additional hardware is used. Users may 
rest assured that no one, including the service provider, would be able to access their messages by 
*vigenere cipher*.

## Vigenere Cipher
Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table.
